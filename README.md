This project requires NodeJs in order to run, since it is a console program.It also requres mongoDb to be installed in order to run. After Node is installed, download the project to your computer and navigate to the directory in a console. Use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies. After you've done that, run 'npm start' to get started. You can use Insomnia to test all of the routes.
